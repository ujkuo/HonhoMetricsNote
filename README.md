# Hon-Ho's Econometrics Lecture Note
- Mainly focus on the content on the blackboard in class.
- Continuously modify and refine notes, but the content and the main structure will not change a lot.
  - I might also add confusion and/or my opinion after studying it.
- Welcome any error report and discussion! I believe there are plenty of typos from Hon-Ho and grammaratically errors from me.
- **Ask me before sending notes or the link of this repo to others.**
